# Trex_runner_version-2.0
It is second generation of my project Trex_runner. Trex_runner play online game name t-rex ,in real time. application using deep learning technique called convolutional neural network(CNN).For training CNN model first we collect image dataset using opencv python module.

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.

A great way to use deep learning to classify images is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN). The **Keras** library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN.

## Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:-

First install python3 

```
https://www.python.org/downloads/this 
```

Then install opencv module in python3 

```
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
pip install opencv-python
```

Then install numpy module in python3

```
https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
pip install numpy
```
And then install keras python3 deep learning library

```
https://pypi.org/project/Keras/
pip install Keras
```
